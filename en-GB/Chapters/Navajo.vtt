have always protected our tribe.

00:36:09.678 --> 00:36:11.750

Now each of you need to stand
next to a talisman.

00:53:59.053 --> 00:54:02.337
There must be a soul attached to each one.

00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:08.821
There's only four of us!

00:54:09.288 --> 00:54:10.488
Five talismans!

00:54:11.197 --> 00:54:14.310
We need the fifth soul to complete the ritual!

00:54:14.337 --> 00:54:19.214
- JAY: This is crazy, Jodie! We're all gonna die
if we don't go inside right now!

00:54:21.947 --> 00:54:23.067
- JODIE: Fuck!

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.080
Fuck! We need one more soul!

00:54:27.533 --> 00:54:28.533
That's it!

00:54:30.228 --> 00:54:32.174
We've got the five souls.

00:54:32.878 --> 00:54:35.345
Shimasani, start the incantation now!

00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:37.915
- SHIMASANI: (CHANTING)

00:54:54.305 --> 00:54:56.825
The passage is open, Jodie!

00:54:57.244 --> 00:55:00.441
You did it! You did it!

00:56:26.395 --> 00:56:27.435
- JAY: Jodie!

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:42.495
- CORY: SHIMASANI!!!!

00:57:00.518 --> 00:57:03.891
- JAY: No white man has ever been
to the place I'm taking you.

00:57:03.985 --> 00:57:07.825
My people have buried our dead there
for many hundreds of years.

00:57:09.276 --> 00:57:11.382
For us, it's sacred land.

00:59:08.699 --> 00:59:10.898
- JODIE: These are the bones of your ancestors.

00:59:12.605 --> 00:59:16.577
I'm sure they would've wanted
to be buried along side with their own people.

01:01:30.777 --> 01:01:33.897
(UNEASY MUSIC PLAYING)

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:56.913
- PAUL: So it's decided?

01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:58.584
You're leaving?

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.730
- JODIE: There's things I have to do.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.578
You know, I...

01:02:06.104 --> 01:02:08.837
I used to think that my gift was a curse.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.606
Maybe I was wrong.

01:02:14.099 --> 01:02:16.366
Maybe I can use it to help people.

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:20.447
Find out who I really am.

01:02:21.684 --> 01:02:23.244
- PAUL: You did a lot for us, Jodie.

01:02:23.888 --> 01:02:26.196
For us and the memory of our people.

01:02:28.428 --> 01:02:30.041
I don't know how to thank you.

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:33.233
(INHALES DEEPLY)

01:02:33.394 --> 01:02:36.504
If you don't find what're  looking for...
come back here.

01:02:37.464 --> 01:02:39.123
You have a home.

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.465
- CORY: I'm gonna miss you.

01:02:52.919 --> 01:02:54.599
- JODIE: Me too, Cory.

01:02:56.007 --> 01:02:57.687
I'll never forget you.

01:03:14.293 --> 01:03:17.237
- JAY: Ashkii's gonna be very sad without you.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.060
- JODIE: But one day I'll come back and see him.

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.517
- CORY: Hey Jodie!

01:03:38.683 --> 01:03:41.634
You didn't think that you're just gonna walk, did you?

01:03:43.607 --> 01:03:46.021
- PAUL: You've spent a long time fixing that bike.

01:03:46.048 --> 01:03:47.914
Take it. It's yours.

01:03:48.967 --> 01:03:51.034
It's the least we can do to thank you.

01:03:52.933 --> 01:03:54.213
- JODIE: Thanks!

01:04:10.045 --> 01:04:11.662
