00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:10.578
- JODIE: Listen, I'm not sure.

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:12.558
Maybe I shouldn't go.

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:17.043
- NATHAN: Jodie, you've been begging me
for weeks, you're not gonna back up now.

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.569
- JODIE: I don't know anybody there.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.379
They might all hate me and...

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:25.191
This dress... This dress is awful.

00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:29.918
Let's just go.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.839
- NATHAN: Just take a deep breath.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.695
There's no reason to panic.

00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:35.884
It's just a birthday party.

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.224
I'm sure everybody will like you.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.770
You'll have fun.
Maybe meet some new friends.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Go on.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:53.704
Oh, don't forget your present.

00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:58.010
It's a book of poetry by Poe.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.002
It's 50 years old and really rare.
I'm sure she'll like it.

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:03.997
Don't worry.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.579
It's gonna be alright.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.139
I'll pick you up at five.

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:10.195
Have fun.

I've gotta go.

00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:45.635
Come in, Jodie. Don't be shy.

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:47.435
- KIRSTEN: Hey... Jodie, right?

00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:50.934
Come on, we're in the living room. Some girls
from my school and the least dorky guys we could find.

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:53.861
Oh, that's the present for me?
Cool. Thanks.

00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:58.733

your friends and don't do anything stupid, alright?

(DOOR SHUTS)

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.479
Finally! She gets the hint.

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:10.373
Hey everyone, this is Jodie.
She's in Unit Four with my mom.

00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:11.968
- BOY 1: Unit Four?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.578
The Paranormal Department?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.000
- BOY 2: Ooh... Whacha do there?

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.852
Bend spoons or speak to dead people,
stuff like that?

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:17.997
- JODIE: No.

00:02:18.053 --> 00:02:19.053
No.

00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:20.408
- KIRSTEN: (CLAPS) Party time!

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:21.600
I'll get the beer.

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:23.844
Guys do the shutters,
girls do the candles.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.828
And Jodie you can take care of the music.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:27.213
Let's get crazy!

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:04.811
(SCOFFS) Slide over.

00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:08.793
We'll put on something from this century.
Something really poping.

00:03:20.047 --> 00:03:22.413
- KIRSTEN: Hid it under my bed for a week.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:30.444
Mom doesn't even go to my room anymore.
She's totally oblivious.

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:32.911
- BOY 2: Kirsten, you're a genius.

00:03:34.124 --> 00:03:35.698
- KRISTEN: Jodie, you want one?

00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:39.315

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:57.407
- JODIE: No... I've had some before.

00:03:57.808 --> 00:03:59.674

- MATT: Hi, I'm Matt. Jodie, right?

00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:46.237
I've never seen you at school before.

00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:48.004
You don't take classes on base?

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:54.402
- JODIE: I'm in a different programme.

00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:56.475
With-with my own teachers.

00:04:58.278 --> 00:04:59.278
It's...

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.717
...kinda boring
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.396
I-I-I never get to see people... my age.

00:05:07.194 --> 00:05:10.250
- MATT: (CHUCKLES)
So you work with Kirsten's mother?

00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:12.701
- JODIE: Yeah.

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:16.180
We work in a same lab.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:21.359
She thought it would be a good idea for me
to come and spend time with people my age, so...

00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:23.815
Uh... Here I am...
(CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)

00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:28.930
- MATT: I used to live in London
before I moved here two years ago.

00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:31.309
And you? Where did you live before?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.980
- JODIE: New York.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.988
- MATT: Man, I love New York.
It's awesome.

00:05:40.877 --> 00:05:43.411
I went there once and it blew me away.

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.235
Do you have any hobbies?
Anything you do for like, fun?

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:52.360
I surf any chance I get and I play
in a band with a bunch of friends.

00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:55.055
And... you? What are you into?

00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:00.025
- JODIE: It's gonna sound really boring...

00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:03.166
I-I like to read... and...

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:05.886
I like sports... (CHUCKLES)

00:06:07.678 --> 00:06:13.009
I mean, I-I can't... I can't leave the base,
so it's sort of limited things.

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:17.771
- MATT: Can I... Can I ask you something?

00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:20.701
Why are you in Unit Four?

00:06:24.997 --> 00:06:27.531
- JODIE: I'd rather not talk about it.
