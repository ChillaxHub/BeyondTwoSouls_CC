Oh my god, what a beautiful
young woman you've become.

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:32.798
Just as pretty as ever.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:35.299

into developing a new condenser.

00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:58.275

- COLE: (SIGHS)

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:14.605
On the day you were born,
a woman named Norah Gray...

00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:17.085
...had a child in the DPA hospital.

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:22.825
The child was declared... still born.

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:32.358
- JODIE: And the father?

00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:35.517
Did you learn anything about him?

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.362
- COLE: His name was Jonathan Nichols.

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:40.944
He died before the birth.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.579

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:44.383

- JODIE: What else did you learn about her?

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.294
- COLE: Not much.

00:02:55.636 --> 00:03:00.303
All I know is that she took part in a DPA
research programme some 20 years back.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.979
She also had a gift.

00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:09.364
- JODIE: Where's Norah now?

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.997
- COLE: She was interned.

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:15.549
In a psychiatric hospital.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.013
Just after she gave birth.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:21.276
According to her file,
she should still be there now.

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:31.169
- JODIE: My mother has been in a...
a mental hospital for 24 years?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.300
I mean, why? What happened?

00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:35.837
- COLE: That's all the file said.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.790
I'm so sorry.

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:42.175
- JODIE: I've gotta go see her.

00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.354
- COLE: Jodie, I know how you feel, but...

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:45.981
She's in a mental hospital.

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:48.763
You might not get the answers
you're looking for.

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.804

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:56.057
I mean, don't you understand?
She's my mother.

00:03:56.448 --> 00:04:00.160
If I look her in the eyes,
I could find out who I truly am.

00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:00.874
- COLE: Jodie.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:06.752
She's in a high security DPA facility
and you're wanted...

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.835

in the country.

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:12.855

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.300
- JODIE: (CHUCKLES) Um...

00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:04.826
I've been better.

00:18:04.925 --> 00:18:07.192
That hit on the head did not help.

00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:10.404
- NATHAN: Ah, I'm sorry.
I told them not to hurt you.

00:18:10.237 --> 00:18:13.245
They just didn't wanna
give you a chance to use Aiden.

00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:23.874
- JODIE: What happened
to my mother, Nathan?

00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:31.401
- NATHAN: Norah...

00:18:31.647 --> 00:18:32.927
...was unstable.

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:37.822
They were afraid she was a dangerous
to herself and her baby.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.611
- JODIE: My mother would never hurt me.

00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:42.684
- NATHAN: They couldn't take that chance, look.

00:18:42.804 --> 00:18:45.936
I was a researcher at the DPA, Jodie.

00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:49.421
I didn't discover
until much later what happened.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.150
- JODIE: Where's Cole?

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.836
- NATHAN: He's at home. He's fine.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.576
I know he was trying to help you.

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:03.472
Don't worry. There won't be any
consequences from last night.

00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:12.584
- JODIE: Why all the lies, Nathan?

00:19:13.367 --> 00:19:16.473
Those... people
pretending to be my parents.

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:20.319
- NATHAN: The DPA thought you needed
a stable emotional environment.

00:19:20.195 --> 00:19:26.381
A home, loving parents, some semblance of a normal life.
Whatever would help us study you in the right conditions.

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:27.982
- JODIE: Study me?

00:19:31.674 --> 00:19:33.047
Study ME?

00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:38.310
(SCOFFS) What was I to you, Nathan?

00:19:39.097 --> 00:19:41.753
A little... lab rat?

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.946
I was just a girl, for fuck's sakes.

00:19:46.316 --> 00:19:47.996
I was just a little girl!

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.903
- NATHAN: No, you were the link!

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:54.886
The link between our world and the Infraworld.
You're everything we've ever dreamt of.

00:19:55.553 --> 00:19:56.913
- JODIE: (SCOFFS)

00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:03.694
So now what?

00:20:04.358 --> 00:20:07.890
You're just gonna hand me back to the CIA.
Is that the plan, Nathan?

00:20:07.784 --> 00:20:13.804
- NATHAN: They brought you here because they have something
for you to do and they'd be very greatful if you do it.

00:20:18.687 --> 00:20:21.766
- JODIE: You're asking me to help
the people who wanted to kill me?

00:20:21.817 --> 00:20:23.916
Is that what you're asking me, Nathan?

00:20:23.277 --> 00:20:24.690
- NATHAN: Listen, Jodie...

00:20:24.277 --> 00:20:26.043
- JODIE: Why should I listen to you?

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.230
You work for them!

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:30.576
And you lied to me about my mother
and my parents and for what?

00:20:30.617 --> 00:20:32.950
The money or the power or the fame?

00:20:32.874 --> 00:20:35.326
- NATHAN: Oh stop that, Jodie.
You know that's not true!

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.367
- JODIE: I know nothing anymore.

00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:41.305
- NATHAN: We know another country's
discovered the Infraworld.

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:43.918
They think it's something
to be controlled or manipulated.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:46.419
They have no idea
what they're dealing with.

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:50.428
If entities enter our world,
do you know what that would mean, Jodie?

00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:54.856
- JODIE: What is all this got to do with me?

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:58.538
- NATHAN: Because you know the Infraworld
better than anyone.

00:21:00.268 --> 00:21:02.135
- JODIE: It's the CIA's job.

00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:05.145
And I'm done with that.

00:21:09.323 --> 00:21:11.856
- NATHAN: They wanna offer you a deal.

00:21:13.174 --> 00:21:14.854
You do this for them...

00:21:15.849 --> 00:21:18.315
And they'll let you out, you're free.

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:23.691
Jodie, you know what would happen
if the passage is opened.

00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:25.612
It'll be the apocalypse.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.540
You have the power to stop this.
