00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.846
- JODIE: I was born with a strange gift.

00:00:07.324 --> 00:00:11.679
The ability to see what no human being has ever seen before.

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:15.156
It's all mixed up in my head.

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:16.684
The images.

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.633
The sounds. The smell.

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:22.946
I need to remember.

00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:27.627
Put things in order right up to this moment.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:30.659
Remember who I am.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.365
If I had to say how it all began...

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.813
I might just as well start here.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.612
- OFFICER: I found you by the side of the road...

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:47.570
...in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:49.765
Was there an accident?

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:52.929
(THUNDERING NOISE)

00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:58.888
Did-did someone tried to hurt you?

00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:01.523
(DOGS BARKING)
(GUN SHOTS)

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:08.118
How 'bout a name?

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:10.059
Someone I could contact?

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:13.692
You must have family.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.219
Friends?

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.535
Someone who could tell me who you are.

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:20.092
(FLASH BACK SOUND)

00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:21.523
- MAN: Hey!

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:27.913
- OFFICER: You don't talk much, do you?

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.009
Well, if you don't help me, I can't help you.

00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:40.414
(SIGH)

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:42.403
We're getting nowhere.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.855
(THUNDERING NOISE)

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.165
Is that a scar?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.700
Is that recent?

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:07.222
- MAN: You've got to stop them.
They have no idea what they're up against.
Tell them to wait until I get there.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:13.652
Get back to them immediately, you hear me?
You've got to stop them!

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:16.425
Goddamn fools.

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:23.222
(OMINOUS NOISES)

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.170
- JODIE: I know...

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.251
They're coming.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:44.648
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:46.230
- OFFICER: Hold on! W-What's going on?

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:48.750
- MAN: The girl you brought in earlier. Where is she?

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.559
- MAN: Jodie, what have you done?
