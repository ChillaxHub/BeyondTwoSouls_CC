- NATHAN: (SOFTLY) Jodie.

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:07.071
Get up.

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:07.858
- JODIE: Huh?

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:11.037
What? What's going on?

00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:16.076
- NATHAN: Get dressed.
I'll explain in the car.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.056
The DPA has launched a programme
to study the other side, The Infra World, as they call it.

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:30.869
They've created a condenser, a machine,
to open a rift to what lies beyond.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.745
- JODIE: They've opened the passage?

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.756
To Aiden's world?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.406
- NATHAN: Something happened last night.

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:41.083
Entities got through the rift
and we couldn't shut down the condenser.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.957
Everybody in the building was slaughtered.
None of the rescue teams came back.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.452
They called and asked for your help.
I <i>told</i> them...

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.396
...you were just a child,
that it was too dangerous.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.970
But they know only you know how to deal
with what lies beyond the rift.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.270

00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.427
If you don't wanna do it
just say it.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.147
And I'll take you back.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:22.955
- JODIE: (SOFTLY) It's alright.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:29.425
I'll do it.

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:46.182

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.799
You can't send her in there!

00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:48.927
What are you thinking?

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.171
- NATHAN: You'll understand.

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:52.358
She's the only one that can stop this.

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:57.800
- SOLDIER: What we got? Any information
coming out of there yet? Anything?

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.638
- MAN: Is that the girl?

00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:02.547
- SOLDIER 2: I'm sorry, miss.
You can't come in here.

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.281

- NATHAN: The condenser
is in the lower basement.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.795
You need to find the control room.
That's all they could tell me.

00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:43.131
Jodie.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.070
The entities around the rift.
They're not like Aiden.

00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:50.865
They're from the depth of the other side
we know almost nothing about them.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:58.043
- JODIE: I've been living with an entity that
I know nothing about since the day I was born.

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:02.779
I get it.

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:06.429
Don't worry.
I don't plan on dying today.
