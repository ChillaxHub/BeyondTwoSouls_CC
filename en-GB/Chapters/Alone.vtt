00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:19.788
- PHILIP: I-I don't know how to tell you this, Jodie.
So I'm just gonna tell you.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.320
Your mom and I, we've been transfered.
We have to leave the base.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.200
We really want to take you with us,
but we think...

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:35.461
Everyone thinks that it would be better for you
to stay here with professor Dawkins.

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:47.754
Of course, we'll come see you
whenever it's possible.

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:49.205
And when you're better...

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:51.360
You'll join us at our new home.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:52.635
Okay?

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:59.454
Well, I think it's for the best.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.250
Goodbye, dear.

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:19.482
- SUZAN: Be brave, darling.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.229
I know this is difficult.

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:32.359
- PHILIP: We... better go... Suzan.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.693
- SUZAN: Just give me a minute, Philip.

00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:50.176
- PHILIP: ### Come on.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.490
- NATHAN: Jodie...

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.570
We're here.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.522
I'll always be here for you.
