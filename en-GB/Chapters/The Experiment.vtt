(CHUCKLES)

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:27.135
I hate to bother you when you're playing

<i>Kathlyn is next door
and she has the same cards as you.</i>

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.937
And we're gonna get her to choose one
and see if you can tell us which one she chose.

00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:36.164
You think you can do that?

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.569
Good.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.355

There's some building blocks on the table
on the other room.

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:45.011
You think you can make them fall over?

00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:54.981
Good, Jodie. Anything else in the room
you can move?

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.779

That's it!

00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:30.760
I'm sorry but I'm done!
