- JODIE: Please Nathan, just this once.

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.730
All the other girls in my class are going
and I won't be late. I promise, okay?

How come everyone can go and I can't?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.110
I do everything you ask of me all week.

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.141
And I never get to have any fun!

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:22.598
- NATHAN: For the hundredth times
you're not like everyone else and there're rules.

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.066
- JODIE: I didn't ask to be different!

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.105
I just wanna go out, and-and
have friends and be like other girls my age.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.921
- NATHAN: You'll never be like them.

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:31.871
You need to get used to that.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:31.331
This is not gonna do you any good.

00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:32.922
You're grounded. Period.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:38.923
Hey, Jodie.

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:42.262
You no better to use Aiden
when you're angry.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:57.273
Are you done?

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.643
Are you proud of yourself?

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:00.708
I hope so.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:03.282
Because you have to clean all that up.

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:12.237
They don't give a shit if we break
everything in this goddamn room.

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.659

I hate myself for doing this.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.489
You understand, right?

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:00.970

It's too late to turn back now.

I just... I'm feeling numb.

00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:37.195
I'm not. I'm feeling sick.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.212
I'm feeling sick
so we were just gonna go...

00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:42.263
