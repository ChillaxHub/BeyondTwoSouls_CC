00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:08.915
- JODIE: Stop it, Aiden. It's your fault
we're in trouble so cut it out!

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:11.098
(DOOR OPENS)

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.997
- SUSAN: He's replacing Dr. Matthews.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.834
He's the one who's gonna be
taking care of you from now on.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.130
He seems really nice.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.807
Go on, he wants to meet you.

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:23.566
Go on, hurry up.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.075
I'll be right here, sweetheart.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.034
- MAN: Hello, Jodie. Come in.

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:45.745
- NATHAN: My name is Nathan.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:47.288
Nathan Dawkins.

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:51.306
I found it would be a good idea for us
to have a little chat

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:53.404
Get to know each other a little better.

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:54.924
That is...

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:57.473
If it's okay with you, of course.

00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:07.630
They're pretty boring books.

00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:10.046
To be honest, I haven't read them all.

00:01:10.163 --> 00:01:11.283
How 'bout you?

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.088
You like to read?

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.043
That's a... photo
of a paranormal event I studied.

00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:31.652
That table moved five millimetres
in three days.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.903
On its own.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.808
We filmed it and sped up the images
so we could see the movement.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.720
Interesting, huh?

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:47.467
You can sit down if you'd like.

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.087
You like it?

00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:16.411
You can have it if you want.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.294
Jodie, my job...

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:31.133
...is to study...

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.910
...strange events.

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:36.860
And then try to explain them.

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:41.338
Like...

00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.077
The things that happened around you.
Right, Jodie?

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.877
Your mother told me
you have an invisible friend.

00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:01.757
This friend, has he been with you
for a long time?

00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:06.681
Since you were born?

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:10.799
Is he a ghost?

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:15.548
Or a... spirit of someone
who passed away?

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:24.075
Can you... draw him for me?

00:04:11.213 --> 00:04:12.893
Mind if I take a look?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.096
Ssso...

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:26.281
This thing is your friend,
and he's connected...

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.445
...to you with some kind of cord.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.360
Is he here right now?

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:40.816
Can you tell him to do something?

00:04:59.847 --> 00:05:00.847
You...

00:05:01.037 --> 00:05:03.571
...tell him what to do and it happens?

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:08.815
- JODIE: I don't... tell Aiden what to do.
No one does.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.981
He's like a lion in a cage.

00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:12.804
We're tied together.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.320
He can't go away.

00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:16.838
It makes him really angry.

00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:21.426
It's not my fault.
I want him to leave too.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.272
He could be really scary sometimes.

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:27.665
- NATHAN: Did-did he do that to you?

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:31.454
- JODIE: No.

00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:33.558
That was the monsters.
