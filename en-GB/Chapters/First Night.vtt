00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:18.144
- SUSAN: It won't be for long.

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:22.642
Just long enough for them
to find out what's going on.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.141
- JODIE: Please, don't leave me here.

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.699
- SUSAN: Just for a couple of days.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.353
You'll see. Time will go by fast.

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.702
- PHILIP: Susan, we need to go.
There's no reason to drag this out.

00:00:38.662 --> 00:00:40.529
- SUSAN: Be brave, darling.

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.069
(SNIFFS) You're strong.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.555
I know you're strong.

00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:08.832
- NATHAN: Jodie.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.637
I know it's hard.

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.188
Leaving your home and your family.

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:17.900
But here we have a better chance
of understanding what's happening.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.006
We can find a way to protect you.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.817
- JODIE: Nobody can protect me.

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:34.720
- NATHAN: Your belonging's
on the bag over there.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:36.942
Cole and I are right nextdoor.

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:42.102
If you need anything or if anything is wrong
Just call and we'll come right away.

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:44.016
Okay?

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:51.969
Good night, Jodie.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.100
- JODIE: Alright.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.959
Find somewhere to change.

00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:22.590
Hope they haven't put cameras in here too.

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:54.925
Come on, Bunny Gruff. Let's see
where we're going to sleep tonight.

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:32.642
- COLE: I'm gonna turn off the light now.
Good night, Jodie.

00:03:32.468 --> 00:03:33.588
- JODIE: Wait.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.516
Can you leave the light on in the hall?

00:03:38.314 --> 00:03:40.381
I don't like it when it's dark.

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:42.182
- COLE: Sure.

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:43.619
How's that?

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:47.276
- JODIE: Good.

00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:49.152
- COLE: Good night.

00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:51.405
- JODIE: Night.

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:57.578
Don't be afraid, Aiden.

00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:59.828
We're gonna have a good night sleep.

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:01.692
And nothing's gonna happen.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.653
(AIDEN REPLIES)

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:23.944
I can't sleep, Aiden.
I think I need a story.

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:18.606
(JODIE SCREAMING)

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:22.663
GET HELP, AIDEN! QUICK!

00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:28.328
- COLE: Woah...

00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:33.132
(JODIE SCREAMING)

00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:26.427
- NATHAN: My god, Jodie.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.721
Get a doctor, hurry!

00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:35.568
- JODIE: It's okay.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.340
It'll be alright now.

00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:40.674
Aiden isn't scared of them anymore.
