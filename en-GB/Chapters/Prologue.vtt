00:00:02.193 --> 00:00:04.859
- JODIE: I was born with a strange gift.

00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:10.679
The ability to see what no human being has ever seen before.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.178
It's all mixed up in my head.

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:15.706
The images.

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:17.622
The sounds. The smell.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:21.979
I need to remember.

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:26.776
Put things in order right up to this moment.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.609
Remember who I am.

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.381
If I had to say how it all began...

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.862
I might just as well start here.
