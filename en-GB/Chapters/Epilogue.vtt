00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.996
- JODIE: Ever since the Black Sun was destroyed.

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:22.144
My memory has been disintegrating.

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:25.462
I spend too much time on the other side.

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:29.823
Now it's eating away up my mind.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.822
Erasing what's left of it.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.656
My memories are all confused.

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:39.519
Slowing self-destructing.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.792
Fading like a dream when you wake up.

00:00:43.618 --> 00:00:46.384
I'm losing my sense of time.

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:51.525
I no longer know what happened before or after...

00:00:52.342 --> 00:00:56.679
Everything's playing
inside my head at the same time.

00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:02.835
It's like watching the same film, looping
over and over again.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.073
A chaos of images with no order.

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:13.780
So I've been writing nigh 'n day for weeks.

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:17.981
Tried to put my life down on paper.

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:21.267
If I forget everything...

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.243
...these pages will be my memory.

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:30.267
- MAN: (VIA TV) <i>Three months after the fact.
The investigation continues.</i>

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.796
<i>In an effort to determine the cause
of the accident that cost 283 lives.

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:38.427
<i>...on a Pentagon military base.</i>

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.190
<i>Government representatives confirm that
the authorities are working hand-in-hand with the investigators...</i>

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:47.615
<i>...to shed light on this appalling tragedy.</i>

00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:50.989
- JODIE: The CIA is leaving me
alone for the moment.

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:55.928
I suppose they're too busy building
another condenser to worry about me.

00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:00.127
I know they'll never abandon their experiments.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:03.406
Now that they know
what's on the other side.

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:06.275
Honestly... (SCOFFS)

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:08.987
I don't give a damn.

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.285
Now I need to reconstruct <i>my life.</i>

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:18.177
My life without Aiden.

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:24.808
For as long as I can remember...

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:27.992
I dreamt of living without him.

00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:31.706
I'm tired...

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:34.859
Without his constant present by my side.

00:02:37.162 --> 00:02:39.181
I got what I wanted.

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:44.542
I've never been so unhappy in my life.

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.747
Feel like...

00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:52.409
...part of me has been empty taken.

00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:56.654
I'm crying all day.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.026
I know it's stupid.

00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:03.592
Shit.

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:08.466
I miss him so much.

00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:54.304
It took months.

00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.927
Months of nothing passing by.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.920
And I woke up.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.010
I think it was time.

00:04:04.934 --> 00:04:06.534
Time to start again.

00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.901
To build a new life.

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:16.156
It was so obvious...

00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:19.930
Deep inside, I always knew...

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.181
I just needed the silence around me.

00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:28.661
To hear what I was feeling.

00:04:32.324 --> 00:04:35.770
I told Ryan I couldn't see my future with him.

00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:40.679
We've been through
too many difficult times together.

00:04:41.492 --> 00:04:43.771
Times I wanna forget.

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:46.924
He said he understood.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:50.782
That he'd wait as long as it takes.

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:54.090
I know I felt something for him.

00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:58.154
But it just wasn't strong enough.

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.436
They took me in while I was alone.

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:04.457
(DOORBELL RINGS)

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.910
When all I could think of was dying.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:12.262
They shared the little they had
without knowing me or judging me...

00:05:12.194 --> 00:05:13.234
- STAN: (SOFLY) Oh my god!

00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:16.118
- JODIE: Deep down I knew
that my place was there.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.972 line:20%
- STAN: Oh my god! Jodie!
Oh my god!

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.279
...with them.

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.636 line:20%
Ah... Jodie, you have to get in here!

00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:23.756
Stan does odd jobs here and there.

00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:26.516
Jimmy gone back to school.
He's clean now.

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.626 line:20%
- JIMMY: Jodie! Oh my god!

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.760
Tuesday works behind the bar.

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:32.698
Walter looks after little Zoey.

00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:32.738 line:20%
- WALTER: Come here, baby girl!

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.693
They're not rolling in money, but...

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.190
They managed.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.422
I've never told them about my past.

00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.383
And they never ask.

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:48.201
They love me for who I am.

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:53.466
Just some... weird chick who talks to spirits.

00:05:56.686 --> 00:05:59.950
Zoey took to me like we'd always known each other.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:07.527
There's something about her big sad eyes
that reminds me of the little girl I once was.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.131
I knew she was different
from the moment I saw her.

00:06:13.711 --> 00:06:16.467
We haven't talked about it, but...

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:20.769
We both know we have something in common.

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.811
I see things at night.

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:28.131 line:20%
(THUNDERING NOISE)

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:31.057
Terrifying things.

00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:37.084
I tell myself that it's only nightmares, but...

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:40.898
I know it's not true.

00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:46.614
Only one who can save the world
with a little girl.

00:06:48.027 --> 00:06:50.050
I have to prepare...

00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:53.887
I know I don't have much time.

00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:58.068
Once the pandora box's opened...

00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:01.323
...it'll never be closed again.

00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:03.228
No...

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.240
It's not nightmares...

00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:10.738
It's what is about to happen.
