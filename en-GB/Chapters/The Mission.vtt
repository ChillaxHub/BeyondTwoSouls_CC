00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.933
One of the most dangerous warlords
in the country.

00:00:06.027 --> 00:00:08.160
He commands a heavily armed militia...

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:11.098
Using it to control several
important districts in the city.

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:13.548
Which means none of our humantarian aid
is getting through.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:16.983
You have to find Gemaal
and eliminate him.

00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:20.634
He relocates twice a day.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.380
Last time we pinpointed him
was at the Zenakhi Hotel, which is right here.

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.650
Not much of a chance he's still there but
it's as good as place as any to start looking.

that was captured here...

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:55.146
...was pulled through the city
behind a jeep.

00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:57.204
They found his head.

00:00:57.263 --> 00:00:59.530

00:31:35.613 --> 00:31:36.613
Fuck!

00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:38.337

00:33:02.289 --> 00:33:03.969
Let's get you outta here.

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:44.157
Ten years in the CIA and
I've never seen anything like it.

00:33:44.566 --> 00:33:47.766
The boss sends his own private helicopter
to get an agent back.

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:50.511
All the top brass are crazy about you, Jodie.

00:33:50.551 --> 00:33:52.231
You and Aiden, of course.

00:33:56.308 --> 00:33:57.308
Jodie.

00:33:57.348 --> 00:33:58.348
You okay?

00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:03.361
Listen.

00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:05.745
I know this one was tough.

00:34:06.307 --> 00:34:08.266
But it's over. We're going home.

00:34:09.517 --> 00:34:12.212
It's just another mission accomplished, right?

00:34:12.413 --> 00:34:15.565
- JODIE: I'll never forget what I saw back there, Ryan.

00:34:18.716 --> 00:34:19.716
Never.

00:34:41.285 --> 00:34:42.965
- RYAN: How's your leg?

00:34:43.482 --> 00:34:46.382
- JODIE: Better when the painkiller kicks in.

00:35:09.534 --> 00:35:11.329
- REPORTER: <i>(VIA TV)
And the international community...</i>

00:35:11.383 --> 00:35:17.442

of the election of the new president Gemaal Sheik Charrief</i>

00:35:18.104 --> 00:35:19.931
- RYAN: <i>Gemaal Sheik Charrief.</i>

00:35:20.024 --> 00:35:23.160
<i>One of the most dangerous warlords
in the country.</i>

00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:25.768
- REPORTER: <i>And now, sources report...</i>

00:35:25.822 --> 00:35:28.170
<i>...that he and all his government...</i>

00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:32.594
<i>...were assassinated in what appears
to be an unclaimed attack.</i>

00:35:33.643 --> 00:35:36.779
- RYAN: <i>You have to find Gemaal
and eliminate him.</i>

00:35:37.577 --> 00:35:38.914
- REPORTER: <i>Hopes were high...</i>

00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:41.371
<i>...that the newly recognised
president Gemaal Charrief...</i>

00:35:41.438 --> 00:35:46.328
<i>...would be able to put an end to the hostilities
that have ravaged his country for many years.</i>

00:35:46.907 --> 00:35:50.304
<i>A number of war leaders
have already expressed outrage...</i>

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:55.219
<i>...at what appears to be nothing less
than a cold-blooded execution.</i>

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.249

00:36:09.336 --> 00:36:11.670
- RYAN: What are you talking about?

00:36:11.591 --> 00:36:13.791
- JODIE: Gemaal wasn't a warlord.

00:36:15.093 --> 00:36:16.773
He was the president.

00:36:17.961 --> 00:36:20.669
He was the democratically elected president!

00:36:20.229 --> 00:36:21.749
- RYAN: Your point?

00:36:21.798 --> 00:36:24.059
We're not politicians, we had our orders.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:26.305
- JODIE: You knew I wouldn't have murdered him!

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.792
So you lied to me!

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.783
- RYAN: Welcome to the CIA, Jodie!

00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:35.576
It's not fucking choir practice in case you haven't noticed.
Now we had a job to do and we did it, end of story!

00:36:35.163 --> 00:36:37.428
- JODIE: This might be just
a fucking job to you...

00:36:37.455 --> 00:36:41.454
Okay? But I don't go around killing people
'cause some four-fucking-star General tells me to

00:36:41.374 --> 00:36:43.054
- PILOT: What's going on?

00:36:48.596 --> 00:36:50.466
- RYAN: Jodie, listen listen...
You calm down!

00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:52.830
Alright, we'll get back home and
we'll talk about it, okay?

- JODIE: You're manipulating me!

00:36:53.614 --> 00:36:55.749
You used me to do your dirty work!

00:36:55.576 --> 00:36:57.449
- RYAN: What difference does it make, Jodie?

00:36:57.076 --> 00:36:59.335

Some kid lost his father because of me!!

00:37:03.747 --> 00:37:05.382
BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOU!

00:37:05.449 --> 00:37:08.599
Because I trusted that
we were doing the right thing!

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.041
What am I to you, Ryan?

00:37:12.278 --> 00:37:13.278
A toy?

00:37:13.509 --> 00:37:17.018
Some fucking puppet that you can just do
whatever you want with?

00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:18.516
- PILOT: We're getting massive turbulence!

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.290

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.856

00:37:20.896 --> 00:37:23.279
- RYAN: Jodie, for god's sake,
you're gonna kill us!

00:37:23.317 --> 00:37:26.389

lie to me again, Ryan.

00:38:00.401 --> 00:38:02.081
- JODIE: They used me...

00:38:03.265 --> 00:38:04.265
...to kill those people.

00:38:04.292 --> 00:38:05.572

00:38:05.372 --> 00:38:06.751
<i>What happened?</i>

00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:12.140
- JODIE: I didn't know. I didn't know.
I was just doing what I was told.

00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:15.257
- NATHAN: <i>Where are you?
Is Clayton with you?</i>

00:38:15.355 --> 00:38:17.061
- JODIE: No... No.

00:38:18.219 --> 00:38:20.116
No, no, I ran away.

00:38:20.935 --> 00:38:24.206
- NATHAN: <i>You can't run away from them.
They'll hunt you down and they'll find you!</i>

00:38:24.246 --> 00:38:27.078

We'll talk. I'm sure that...</i>

- JODIE: It's over, Nathan.

00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:32.046
I'm through being their toy.

00:38:34.851 --> 00:38:36.131
You tell them...

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:39.021
