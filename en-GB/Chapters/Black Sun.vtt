00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:06.213
- MCGRATH: The act of the condenser in the Republic of Karzirstan
has been destroyed and the rift is now inaccessible.

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:09.880
We're now the only nation
with access to the Infra World.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.210
This situation...

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.736
...opens up new strategic...

00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:18.245
...and military respectives.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.222
We're gonna launch a new programme
to discover possible energy resources.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.802
And develop military applications.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.493
We've already found ways
of linking entities to human soldiers.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.618
And this is just the beginning.

00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:38.243
Now this is more important than
the race to space or developing nuclear capability.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:42.106
We have discovered a new world.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.876
A world for us to conquer.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.983
This... is the beginning...

00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:52.317
...of a new era... for our nation.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.739
(CLAPPING SOUND)

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.927
- RYAN: Pentagon top brass getting you down?

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:28.619
- JODIE: They were busy talking about their plans
to take over the world.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.840
So I left them to it.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:34.084
- RYAN: Now we've played our part in all of this.

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:42.479
- JODIE: I shouldn't have accepted that mission.

00:01:43.227 --> 00:01:46.700
I was only thinking about my freedom
and now it's stupid.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.497
- RYAN: So what are you gonna do now?

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:00.397
- JODIE: I don't know.

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.505
I'm gonna need some time to...

00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:05.888
...to figure it out.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.501
Figure out what I really want.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:12.713
And what about you?

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:15.201
- RYAN: CIA has it all mapped up for me.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:19.068
Top-tier big car, golf meetings.

00:02:19.697 --> 00:02:21.874
I haven't given them the answer yet, but...

00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.341
It's worth considering.

00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:27.101
Listen.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.489
Jodie, I...

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.659
I know it's been complicated between us.

00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:36.450
And I didn't know ### do the right thing.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.736
But maybe we could start again.

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:42.722
You know, try to build something together.

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.559
I mean, after...

00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:48.428
...all this stuff that we've been through.
Maybe we can make it work.

00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:54.198
- JODIE: I'm not ready.

00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:59.597
I think I need some time.

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:04.191
I'm sorry, Ryan.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.834
- RYAN: I understand.

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:13.167
But whatever you do...

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:16.637
...you should remember
I'll always be there for you.

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:19.371
- COLE: Aw, there you are!

00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.030
Nathan's looking for you. Come on.
I'll take you to his office.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.110
Later Ryan.

00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:24.869
Oh, you know what?

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:27.719
I've got a single ### in my office that needs sharing.

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:29.226
Meet you in a few?

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.299
- RYAN: No, I don't think I...

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.023
- COLE: Come on!

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.417
Don't make me drink it alone.
Waste of a good bottle!

00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:37.056
I'll tell you ###, okay?

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:38.963
This way, Jodie.

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.591
Some decisions are hard to make, huh, Jodie?

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:03.285
- JODIE: Some one always decided for me.

00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:05.616
It's not ### make my own choices.

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:07.270
- COLE: You just do what your heart tells you.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.210
Then you'll know you make the right decision.

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:44.313
Alright, here we are.

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:46.269
Call me when you're done.
I'll come pick you up.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.069
- JODIE: Okay.

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:55.656
- COLE: Whatever Nathan says...

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.160
...be careful.

00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:13.633
- NATHAN: Come in.

00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:26.118
Jodie!

00:05:27.257 --> 00:05:29.124
I'm so glad to see you safe.

00:05:37.634 --> 00:05:40.234
- JODIE: I kept my part of the bargain.

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:42.115
Now it's the CIA's turn.

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:50.237
- NATHAN: As far as the CIA concerned.

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:54.615
You no longer exist.

00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:09.558
You're now Elizabeth North.

00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:11.487
New identity and new life.

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.281
Five hundred thousand dollars.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.925
For sevices rendered.

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.851
That should help making new start.

00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:36.304
- JODIE: Thanks.

00:06:44.452 --> 00:06:46.132
- NATHAN: Before you go...

00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:50.771
There's one last thing I'd like to ask.

00:06:55.927 --> 00:06:56.927
When my...

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.760
...wife and daughter disappeared in that accident...

00:07:01.818 --> 00:07:03.498
...fifteen years ago.

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:06.952
I wanted to die too.

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:08.325
I cried a lot.

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:12.327
Banging my head....

00:07:12.541 --> 00:07:15.441
...against the wall trying to figure out why? Why?

00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:17.554
Why them?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.920
Never being able to hold them again.

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:27.384
It's like a wound that wouldn't heal.

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:31.512
But then you came along.

00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:34.663
Then I realised...

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.633
...they were still here all the time. Near me.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.730
I just couldn't see.

00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:55.765
Government gave me everything I needed...

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:57.916
...to study the Infra World.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.747
They were interested in military applications.

00:08:00.787 --> 00:08:04.065
I was interested in seeing my family again.

00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:06.474
Taking me some years.

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:10.159
But I finally succeeded in creating this.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.360
Hello, my darlings.

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:26.243
Helen.

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:32.188
Laura.

00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:34.841
I miss you so much!

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.223
I could just see them every day.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.268
Soon we'll be together.

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.042
I'm working on a modified condenser...

00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:50.702
...that can communicate with souls
of the Infra World.

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:54.475
Speaking with the death, Jodie.

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:56.181
Can you imagine?

00:08:57.816 --> 00:08:59.717
- JODIE: What do you want from me?

00:08:59.758 --> 00:09:02.658
- NATHAN: I want you to help me talk to them.

00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:04.775
To hear their voices.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:06.909
I wanna tell them what I'm doing.

00:09:06.822 --> 00:09:10.994
Until I finish my research,
you're the only one that can do it.

00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:16.785
- JODIE: Give me your hands.

00:09:41.387 --> 00:09:42.827
- NATHAN: Helen...

00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:44.657
My darling.

00:09:47.497 --> 00:09:49.220
I miss you so much.

00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:52.767
- JODIE: (IN HELEN VOICE)
<i>Let us go, Nathan!</i>

00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:54.677
<i>You're hurting us!</i>

00:09:55.068 --> 00:09:57.167
<i>You gotta let us go!</i>

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.282
<i>LET US DIE!</i>

00:10:00.163 --> 00:10:01.582
- NATHAN: You!

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:02.916
You're lying!

00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.177
Helen didn't say that, you did!

00:10:06.593 --> 00:10:08.833
- JODIE: You're keeping them here.

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:13.032
They're being torn apart between two worlds.

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:16.925
- NATHAN: (YELLS) That's not true!
You're lying! I know they wanna be with me again!

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.658
I know they wanna be with me!!

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.143
- JODIE: They're suffering, Nathan!

00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:25.655
If you love them...

00:10:25.482 --> 00:10:29.114
If you... if you really love them
you've gotta let them go!

00:10:28.954 --> 00:10:30.634
You can't cheat death!

00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:31.884
- NATHAN: (YELLS) Cheat death?

00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:33.591
Death is nothing! You hear me?

00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:35.195
NOTHING!!

00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:39.890
- JODIE: Goodbye, Nathan.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.489
I hope you find peace.

00:12:01.289 --> 00:12:02.969
- MCGRATH: Hi, Jodie.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:05.959
Good to see you again.

00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:12.388
Well, you put us in a difficult situation, you know that.

00:12:14.478 --> 00:12:16.078
We can't let you go.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.340
We can't kill you either.

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:22.705
### don't know what do on the other side.

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:26.954
### anyone appropriate solution.

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:32.259
We inject you with a neuro acid.

00:12:32.313 --> 00:12:36.423
Which will put you in a permanent coma.

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:40.791
Exactly what we did with your mother.

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:44.456
A simple and...

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.460
...elegant way to put an end to our...

00:12:47.905 --> 00:12:49.425
...<i>"collaboration."</i>

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.500
Goodbye, Jodie.

00:12:56.585 --> 00:12:59.772
We will always be...
greatful for your help.

00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:03.347
(DOOR OPENS)

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.840
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:25.529
- NATHAN: Jodie...

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:32.051
You opened my eyes. It was so obvious
but I didn't want to see.

00:13:33.742 --> 00:13:35.667
- JODIE: (WEAKLY) Help me, Nathan.

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:40.290
- NATHAN: I'm gonna accomplish
man's oldest dream.
