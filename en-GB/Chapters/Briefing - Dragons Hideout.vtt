- MCGRATH: According to our intel, the Republic of Karzistan
has discovered the existence of the Infra World.

00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:14.482
Found a rift. Conducting experiment
from a super base...

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.332

and their experiments.

But we've detected ### fluctuation
within the Infra World.

to interact with the other souls.

00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:33.666
- MCGRATH: Now your mission is to destroy
the condenser and any advanced technology you find.

- JODIE: Even if we managed
to destroy the condenser the rift will still be there.

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:42.205
- MCGRATH: Building a condenser is a costly
and time-consuming business.

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:45.722
But this operation will gain time
to better understand the Infra World.

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.261
And make sure that no one
tries to use it against us.

will be heavily guarded.
