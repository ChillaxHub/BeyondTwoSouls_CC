Is that what time it is?

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.419
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry
I was concentrating on my work.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:45.028

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.100
Hey.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.399
This morning, I bought you a book.

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:51.452
What do you say we get you tucked in
and I read it to you?

I must've left it in the other room.

Why don't you go in there and get it.
I'll finish up here.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.760

Stop it, Aiden!
It's not funny!

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.820
Aiden?

00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:41.955
Uh... you're doing that, Aiden?

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:32.589
Jodie, you okay?

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:35.893
You look pale.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.406
- COLE: She looks dead tired
is how she looks.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.337

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:31.344
Drunk driver.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.500
Wrong side of the road.

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:48.566
