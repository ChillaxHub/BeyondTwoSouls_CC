and thirsty.

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:31.445
And I have no clue where we fucking are
so just play nice and give me a break, okay?

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:45.609
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.916
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.462
I'm dying of thirst.

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:54.752
And everything's fucked.

00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:56.473

Hi. I'm so sorry to disturb you.

00:02:55.963 --> 00:03:00.702
I'm just looking for some place
to spend the night and I was hoping...

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:03.484
- MAN: You can't stay here. Sorry.

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:05.415
- JODIE: Can I just...

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.665
Can I just spend the night in your barn?

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:12.105
Please, I mean, I promise,
I will be gone by morning.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.778
- MAN: I told you, you can't stay here.

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:16.257
You need to leave now.

You can stay here tonight.

00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:37.711
Come in.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:46.073
What's your name?

00:03:46.984 --> 00:03:48.184

00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:53.363
These are my sons, Cory and Jay.

00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:55.987
My mother, Shimasami.

00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:59.251
Don't be surprise if she doesn't answer you.

00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.091
She hasn't spoken in years.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.142
We're about to have dinner.

00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.061
Would you like to eat with us?

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:09.767
- JODIE: Yeah.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.180
Yeah, thank you!

- PAUL: We don't see many
hitchhikers around here.

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:26.573
Can I ask where you're heading?

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.141
- JODIE: I just... keep moving
from day to day.

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:39.617
I guess if I keep going
long enough I'll...

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.911
...figure out where I'm heading.

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.209

00:06:12.814 --> 00:06:15.281
My family lived here for generations.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.038
I was born here.

00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:19.898
And probably die here.

00:06:22.626 --> 00:06:24.306
I told my boys to go...

00:06:24.213 --> 00:06:26.430
I know there's nothing for them here.

00:06:26.537 --> 00:06:27.537
But uh...

00:06:28.334 --> 00:06:31.477
They wanted to stay
with their grandmother and me, so...
