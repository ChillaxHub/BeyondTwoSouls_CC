is getting through.

00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:57.204
They found his head.

00:00:57.263 --> 00:00:59.530

00:36:20.229 --> 00:36:21.749
- RYAN: Your point?

00:36:21.798 --> 00:36:24.059
We're not politicians, we had our orders.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:26.305
- JODIE: You knew I wouldn't have murdered him!

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.792
So you lied to me!

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.783
- RYAN: Welcome to the CIA, Jodie!

00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:35.576
It's not fucking quite a practise in case you haven't noticed.
Now we had a job to do and we did it, end of story!

00:36:35.163 --> 00:36:37.428
- JODIE: This might be just
a fucking job to you...

00:36:37.455 --> 00:36:41.454
Okay? But I don't go around killing people
'cause some four-fucking-star general tells me to

00:36:41.374 --> 00:36:43.054
- PILOT: What's going on?

00:36:48.596 --> 00:36:50.466
- RYAN: Jodie, listen listen...
You calm down!

00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:52.830
Alright, we'll get back ###
we can talk about it, okay?

00:36:52.004 --> 00:36:54.137 position:0% size:50% line:50%
- JODIE: You're manipulating me!

00:36:53.614 --> 00:36:55.749
You used me to do your dirty work!

00:36:55.576 --> 00:36:57.449
- RYAN: What difference does it make, Jodie?

00:36:57.076 --> 00:36:59.335
He was a dead man walking
with or without you!

00:36:58.789 --> 00:37:00.837 position:0% size:50% line:50%
- JODIE: I HAVE BLOOD ON MY HANDS!!

00:37:00.744 --> 00:37:03.411
Some kid lost his father because of me!!

00:37:03.747 --> 00:37:05.382
BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOU!

00:37:05.449 --> 00:37:08.599
Because I trusted that
we were doing the right thing!

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.041
What am I to you, Ryan?

00:37:12.278 --> 00:37:13.278
A toy?

00:37:13.509 --> 00:37:17.018
Some fucking puppet that you can just do
whatever you want with?

00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:18.516
- PILOT: We're getting massive turbulence!

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.290
- JODIE: Fuck!

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.856
- PILOT: I can't... I can't control it!

00:37:20.896 --> 00:37:23.279
- RYAN: Jodie, for god's sake,
you're gonna kill us!

00:37:23.317 --> 00:37:26.389
- JODIE: No one's ever gonna
lie to me again, Ryan.

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:28.782
- RYAN: Jodie!

00:37:28.973 --> 00:37:29.973
Fuck!

00:37:43.997 --> 00:37:46.832
- JODIE: (SOBBING)

00:37:56.247 --> 00:37:57.927
- NATHAN: <i>Nathan Dawkins.</i>

00:38:00.401 --> 00:38:02.081
- JODIE: They used me...

00:38:03.265 --> 00:38:04.265
...to kill those people.

00:38:04.292 --> 00:38:05.572
- NATHAN: <i>Jodie?</i>

00:38:05.372 --> 00:38:06.751
<i>What happened?</i>

00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:12.140
- JODIE: I didn't know. I didn't know.
I was just doing what I was told.

00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:15.257
- NATHAN: <i>Where are you?
Is Clayton with you?</i>

00:38:15.355 --> 00:38:17.061
- JODIE: No... No.

00:38:18.219 --> 00:38:20.116
No, no, I ran away.

00:38:20.935 --> 00:38:24.206
- NATHAN: <i>You can't run away from them.
They'll hunt you down and they'll find you!</i>

00:38:24.246 --> 00:38:27.078
<i>You gotta come in, Jodie.
We'll talk. I'm sure they'll...</i>

00:38:26.959 --> 00:38:28.759
- JODIE: It's over, Nathan.

00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:32.046
###

00:38:34.851 --> 00:38:36.131
You tell them...

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:39.021
...that if they try to find me, I'll kill them.

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:40.305
- NATHAN: <i>Jodie, listen...</i>

00:38:39.959 --> 00:38:41.759
- JODIE: Tell them, Nathan!

00:38:45.775 --> 00:38:46.975
I'll kill them.
