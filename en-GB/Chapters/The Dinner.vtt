- RYAN: <i>I was just wondering
if you got my email.</i>

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:33.042
- JODIE: W-Wh-Wh-What email?

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:35.722
- RYAN: <i>The one I sent three days ago.</i>

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:43.337
- JODIE: You know I...
I've actually been having problems with my computer.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.030
Wh-What was the email about?

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:44.875

maybe another time?</i>

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:58.352
Shit, I'm so sorry... I...

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:04.357
You know what... Why don't you
come over here for dinner tonight?

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:08.182
I mean you wanted to see
my apartment anyway, so...

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.975
- RYAN: <i>Urm... Sure... But uh...</i>

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:12.029

a kick-arse bottle of wine. See you later.</i>

Now I get why you blasted my computer.

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:41.329

I'm not yours, Aiden!

00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:02.254
I can have a relationship with whoever I want.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.641
This is my life.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.762
I happen to think Ryan is great.

00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:18.245
He's charming, he's intelligent, he's funny...

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:22.658
And I... think I'm falling for him. (CHUCKLES)

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.199
Okay...

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.839
Okay.

Seven o'clock.

00:02:29.573 --> 00:02:32.186
I've an hour to make dinner...

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:35.279
Tidy up and... make myself look good.

00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.298

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.889

in the basket in the bathroom.

Oh my god, the dinner!

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.824
Okay, th-there's gotta be
something in the kitchen.

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:40.912
I gotta find something
that I can make in one hour...

00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:42.877
With whatever left in the fridge.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:45.908
Asian beef...

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:47.895
I mean that looks good...

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:49.861
It's not too complicated.

00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:54.970
Curry chicken
with oven-baked vegetables.

00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.221
It'll take some time
in the oven but...

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.745
...seems doable.

00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:05.211
Pizza delivery.

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:07.971
I mean it's...

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.156
Not exactly gourmet but it...

00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.571
No preparation, no mess.
I mean...

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.300
Could be an option.

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:22.249
Yeah...

00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:25.428
Asian beef, I mean
it looks suitably exotic.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.259

I don't manage to fuck it up.

- RYAN: Also, when did you move in?

00:20:18.892 --> 00:20:21.159
- JODIE: Um... Couple weeks ago...

00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:24.799
Yeah... The agency found it for me
and all furnished and everything... I just...

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.489
Actually, the first place I've ever had.

00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:32.387
And how about you,
where do you live?

00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:34.613
- RYAN: Oh, I have a place
just outside of town.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:37.401
It's small but you know,
it has a little garden.

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:39.815
- JODIE: And... did you...
Did you grow up here or...?

00:20:39.562 --> 00:20:41.722
- RYAN: No, no I was born in Oregon.

00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:43.885
My parents and brother still live there.

00:20:43.712 --> 00:20:46.312
But I moved out
when I was sixteen.

00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:48.318
- JODIE: Sixteen?

00:20:50.602 --> 00:20:51.602
Did you...

00:20:52.075 --> 00:20:54.141
...get kicked out or something?

00:20:55.693 --> 00:20:56.733
- RYAN: Ah...

00:20:57.692 --> 00:21:00.599
Things were pretty...
chaotic at home.

00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:05.285
My stepfather liked to beat me
when he had too much to drink.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.099
And... uh...

00:21:06.612 --> 00:21:10.132
I just decided to get out
before one of us went too far.

00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:17.329
- JODIE: Um...

00:21:17.926 --> 00:21:20.259
How did you end up joining the CIA?

00:21:21.138 --> 00:21:24.978
- RYAN: I... ah... I went to college.
Not really knowing what I wanted to do...

00:21:25.611 --> 00:21:26.811
Tried the army.

00:21:26.948 --> 00:21:29.747
You know, actio, travel, adventure...

00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:30.254
- JODIE: (CHUCKLES)

00:21:29.868 --> 00:21:32.441
Long enough to realise
that wasn't for me.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.064
And when the CIA agent recruiter
approached to me and I jumped at it.

00:21:44.127 --> 00:21:45.527
- JODIE: I should probably...

00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:47.847
You know, I'm gonna go
check on the dinner because...

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.519
This cooking thing
is a whole new adventure for me.

00:21:50.293 --> 00:21:51.733
- RYAN: (CHUCKLES)

00:21:53.494 --> 00:21:54.614
You need help?

00:21:54.722 --> 00:21:58.442
- JODIE: No, but why don't you go sit
and more wine would be nice. (CHUCKLES)

00:21:58.242 --> 00:21:59.282
- RYAN: Okay.

00:22:10.587 --> 00:22:12.720
- RYAN: Ah... Asian beef, right?

00:22:13.086 --> 00:22:14.145
- JODIE: Yeah... is...

00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:16.967
- RYAN: I was sent to China a year.
I love Asian food.

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:17.994
- JODIE: Oh... well...

00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:20.704
Do not get your hopes up. (CHUCKLES)

00:22:20.557 --> 00:22:24.682
This is... probably the second time
that I've cooked. And...

00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:27.709
I would rather not
talk about the first time.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.360
- RYAN: Hm...

00:22:34.473 --> 00:22:35.513
This is good.

00:22:36.924 --> 00:22:39.707
- JODIE: Good. I'm-I'm glad.
I'm glad you like it.

00:22:43.965 --> 00:22:45.512
- RYAN: So we've been working
together now for... what?

00:22:45.325 --> 00:22:46.765
Like... two years?

00:22:46.792 --> 00:22:49.192
And I know almost nothing about you.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.539
- JODIE: I mean...
There's nothing much to say.

00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:58.591
I grew up with my parents
on the DPA campus. And then...

00:22:58.645 --> 00:23:00.778
And then Nathan looked after me.

00:23:01.225 --> 00:23:04.368
Well... I mean...
You pretty much know the rest, so...

00:23:06.337 --> 00:23:09.470
- RYAN: Yeah, your parents...
Do you... uh... you still see them?

00:23:11.195 --> 00:23:12.195
- JODIE: No.

00:23:12.722 --> 00:23:14.082
No, I don't. I...

00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:18.385
I think they were just...
terrified about how different I was.

00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:22.144
So...

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.307
Nathan and...

00:23:23.864 --> 00:23:26.637
...Cole, th-they brought me up,
more or less.

00:23:26.744 --> 00:23:29.278
They taught me how to cope with Aiden.

00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:32.627
How to accept myself as I am.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.108
I mean it wasn't always easy, but...

00:23:34.935 --> 00:23:37.035
I'm... making progress.

00:23:38.592 --> 00:23:43.429
- RYAN: Yeah, d-did Nathan manage to explain
to you why you have this... link with Aiden?

00:23:43.536 --> 00:23:44.536
- JODIE: No.

00:23:45.183 --> 00:23:46.623
I mean not really.

00:23:47.137 --> 00:23:50.924
They learnt a lot of stuff
about the Infraworld.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.267
Really not much about Aiden.

00:23:55.353 --> 00:23:58.953
I mean I-I don't think
even he knows who...

00:23:59.087 --> 00:24:00.820
...or what he is.

00:24:00.513 --> 00:24:01.953
- RYAN: (CHUCKLES)

00:24:02.832 --> 00:24:03.832
It's like...

00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:07.470
Is he here now? Listening to us?

00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:09.546
- JODIE: Yeah.

00:24:11.094 --> 00:24:12.774
Yeah, he never leaves me.

00:24:17.174 --> 00:24:18.174
Uh...

00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:20.813
What about you?
Do you have a family here?

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.163
- RYAN: No. Now my... ah...
My parents are just still in Oregon.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.403
I go to see 'em as little as possible.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.937
- JODIE: (CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.170
And are you... uhm...

00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:34.573
Are you married or anything?

00:24:34.627 --> 00:24:36.293
- RYAN: No no... (STUTTERS)

00:24:36.187 --> 00:24:37.946
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Yeah, I mean I-I (STUTTERS)

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:38.999
I was.

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:43.291
Yeah, my ex-wife and I have been separated
for... uh... two years

00:24:43.314 --> 00:24:45.206
And... uh... (INHALES DEEPLY)

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.420
Yeah, that couldn't work.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.154
I mean, in the end it didn't.

00:24:47.947 --> 00:24:52.159
You know, we had our good times but... uh...
eventually we decided to go our separate ways.

00:24:53.596 --> 00:24:54.716
How 'bout you?

00:24:55.247 --> 00:24:56.927
Anyone on your radar?

00:25:00.689 --> 00:25:02.369
- JODIE: (QUIETLY) No.

00:25:03.962 --> 00:25:05.642
I've got Aiden, so...

00:25:07.723 --> 00:25:10.057
- RYAN: I mean anyone in <i>our</i> world.

00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:14.404
- JODIE: You know...

00:25:14.577 --> 00:25:15.857
Aiden kind of...

00:25:16.603 --> 00:25:18.936
...has always made people run away.

00:25:20.664 --> 00:25:22.507
Or maybe it's me.

00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.632
Maybe I'm just...

00:25:25.871 --> 00:25:28.604
...to odd for anyone to be interested in.

00:25:29.656 --> 00:25:31.003
- RYAN: You're special.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.070
Jodie.

00:25:33.512 --> 00:25:35.779
Aiden's got nothing to do with this.

00:25:44.162 --> 00:25:45.962
- JODIE: Uh... I'm sorry...

00:25:46.627 --> 00:25:48.147
- RYAN: No, I-I-I... I thought you...

00:25:47.801 --> 00:25:48.921
- JODIE: No...

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:51.476
No, it's not... it...

00:25:52.077 --> 00:25:54.077
I-I... It's my fault... I'm...

00:25:53.874 --> 00:25:56.351
I just... I-I can't... I'm...

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:01.452
- RYAN: Uh...
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

00:26:01.474 --> 00:26:02.651
I better go.

00:26:09.189 --> 00:26:10.189
(DOOR OPENS)

00:26:10.242 --> 00:26:11.242
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:14.315
- JODIE: Are you happy, Aiden?

00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:17.319
You got what you wanted.

00:26:18.017 --> 00:26:19.217
(AIDEN REPLIES)

00:26:21.903 --> 00:26:24.236
Yeah, I know it's not your fault.

00:26:26.431 --> 00:26:28.111
I completely freaked out.

00:26:29.899 --> 00:26:31.899
He's gonna think I'm an idiot.

00:26:32.915 --> 00:26:34.915
I <i>am</i> such a fucking idiot!

00:26:35.282 --> 00:26:36.754
(AIDEN SPEAKS)

00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:40.929
You know, you were right.

00:26:44.368 --> 00:26:46.234
Maybe he's just not my type.

00:26:50.737 --> 00:26:52.417
I wonder if anyone is.

00:26:52.786 --> 00:26:54.652
(AIDEN SPEAKS)

00:27:02.605 --> 00:27:04.672
I always got you, Aiden, right?
