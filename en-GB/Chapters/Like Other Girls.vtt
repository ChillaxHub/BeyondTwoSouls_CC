00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.302
- NATHAN: I said no. End of story.

00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:04.682
- JODIE: Please Nathan, just this once.

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.730
All the other girls in my class are going
and I won't be late. I promise, okay?

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.973
- NATHAN: You're wasting your breathe, Jodie.

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.536
- JODIE: IT'S JUST NOT FAIR!

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:14.222
How come everyone can go and I can't?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.110
I do everything you ask of me all week.

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.141
And I never get to have any fun!

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:22.598
- NATHAN: For the hundredth times
you're not like everyone else and there're rules.

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.066
- JODIE: I didn't ask to be different!

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.105
I just wanna go out, and-and
have friends and be like other girls my age.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.921
- NATHAN: You'll never be like them.

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:31.871
You need to get used to that.

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:35.599
Good night.

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:39.478
- JODIE: (SHOUT FRUSTRATINGLY)

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.721
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.622
- COLE: I'll be nextdoor.
Tell me if you need anything.

00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:05.348
(DOOR OPENS)

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.020
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:14.117
- JODIE: Fuck it.

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:34.232
(LOUD ELECTRIC GUITAR SOUND)

00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:29.128
- COLE: Stop it, Jodie!

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:31.331
This is not gonna do you any good.

00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:32.922
You're grounded. Period.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:38.923
Hey, Jodie.

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:42.262
You no better to use Aiden
when you're angry.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:57.273
Are you done?

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.643
Are you proud of yourself?

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:00.708
I hope so.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:03.282
Because you have to clean all that up.

00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.478
- JODIE: Stop it, Aiden.

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:12.237
They don't give a shit if we break
everything in this goddamn room.

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.659
If that's not gonna work
we have to figure out what will.

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.373
(PHONE RINGS)

00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:27.431
- COLE: Yeah... (CHUCKLES)

00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:50.518
- JODIE: I'm-I'm really sorry, Cole.

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:53.097
I hate myself for doing this.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.489
You understand, right?

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:00.970
I just... I need to go out tonight.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:15.366
(AIDEN SPEAKS)

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.520
Yeah, I know.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.024
It's too late to turn back now.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:35.767
Locked.
